# StringBuilder

* Strings are immutable
* StringBuilder objects are not (i.e. mutable)

Note: 
* String should always be used unless StringBuilder offers an advantage. For ex. better performance
<br> **Example** - If you need to concatenate a large number of strings, such as a temporary error message
